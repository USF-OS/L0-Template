# Lab 0: Getting to Know You

Welcome! I'm excited to have you in class and am looking forward to getting to
know you over the course of the semester. This first lab assignment has three
goals:

* For you to tell me a little bit more about yourself
* Testing out the assignment submission process
* Getting started on the course discussion board

## Part I: Introduction

Let's get started! To submit your responses, *edit this document* and write in
the space provided. Note: apart from
your USF username, all the questions are private and **completely optional**.

1. USF Username (required): (replace this with your response)

(Please make sure you enter the previous answer on the *same line* as the
question. This way our script will be able to automatically link your GitHub
username with your USF username).

2. Preferred Pronouns (he/his, she/her, they/their, ze/zir, etc.): (replace this with your response)

3. Preferred Name/Nickname: (replace this with your response)

4. Tell me something about yourself (if you want), and anything I can do to
   help you succeed this semester. This can include things that help me
   accommodate your learning a bit better (e.g., "I commute in from Sacramento
   every day in a horse-drawn carriage, so sometimes I might be a bit late") or
   if you'd like to stop by and chat about something feel free to let me know
   here.

5. If you are **not** currently registered for the class, please explain your
   situation below:

## Part II: Discussion Board

That wasn't too bad, was it? The next part of this lab is to set up your account on the discussion board. Please visit:

https://cs326.sigpipe.io

Your account should already be set up:

Username: (USF Username)  
Password: (Your USF Student ID number -- the **full** thing, starting with '20')  

Find the "Lab 0" thread there and follow the directions to finish the lab. Thanks, and looking forward to a great semester!
